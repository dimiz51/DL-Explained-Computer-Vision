### Classification example notes

Things I need to explain:

1. tensorflow-datasets + whats a dataset and why do we need it?
2. How does our Cifar10 dataset look and how does a sample look?
3. Dataset splits
4. How to iterate the dataset? What is an epoch?
5. What is the batch size and why do we need to shuffle?\
6. Importance of pre-processing(augmentation and normalization) and training randomness
7. How to build an efficient input pipeline(caching,vectorized mapping vs parallel benefits, prefetching)? 
8. Explain Keras Sequential/Functional differences
9. Explain Pooling,Flatten,Dense,Dropout and Conv2D layers as well as the order of ops
10. Loss funcs (Role of loss funcs)
11. Explain metrics for multiclass classification
