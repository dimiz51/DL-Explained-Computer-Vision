### Classification example notes

Things I need to explain:

1. tensorflow-datasets + whats a dataset?
2. How does our Cifar10 dataset look and how does a sample look?
3. How to iterate the dataset?
4. How to build an efficient input pipeline(caching,vectorized mapping vs parallel benefits, prefetching)? 
5. What is the batch size and why do we need to shuffle?
6. Importance of pre-processing(augmentation and normalization) and training randomness
7. Dataset splits
8. Explain Pooling,Flatten,Dense,Dropout and Conv2D layers as well as the order of ops
9. Explain activation funcs
10. Loss funcs
11. Bonus ! Explain different types of pooling
